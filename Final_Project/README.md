# Final Project: Predicting Septic Shock in the ICU
## Casey Weiner
#### In this project, I used data collected by the [Winslow Lab](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/faculty_staff/raimond-l-winslow-phd/) at Johns Hopkins University to make a classifier for predicting the onset of septic shock for patients with sepsis in the ICU. This work is described in the paper located [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-42637-5).
